                <p>I’m currently a student in the junior year of the IBDP

                     from the racing to the physics behind it, so I participated in the f1 in
                      schools competition in which I was the car designer — our car ended up being 
                      2nd fastest out of 97 teams. You can find more details about it and other
                     things that I do/did below.

                <p class="thing-description">
                    One day my dad and I were walking through a park and he was explaining how a camera works. 
                    Then suddenly I had the thought , why not just change the shape of the lens instead of doing 
                    so much movement? Then another day I was preparing for my physics exam and there was a section 
                    about how the eye worked.  Then I got the idea of making lenses with liquid. It seemed like 
                    a really good idea, until I actually started to look into it and try making it - I made small 
                    prototypes . However, it turned out that there were lots of problems, and for some reason it
                     took me even longer to find out that it had already been invented a decade ago. 
                    Still, I liked the idea and saw some potential in it and kept going with it.

                <p class="thing-description">
                    Right after my 10th grade board exams I wanted to make websites for clients. So,
                     I decided to cold call a couple of CAs. After some time one CA agreed to me making 
                     a complete website for him, at the time I said I would do it for free. Then, as 
                     time went by he sent me all the details and I started coding the website. We discussed 
                     about what all he wanted in his website,
                     and after going back and forth the website was ready to deploy.

                <p class="thing-description">
                    I’ve always been passionate about racing, go karting and formula 1. Naturally, I’d 
                    like to have my own kart, customize it , and race around with it. This would not even 
                    take too long to make. However, I don’t have the money for this. Making a go kart from 
                    scratch requires lots of investment, even basic parts like tires can cost a lot. Hopefully,
                    I get the funds for it in the future.

                <h3>F1 in Schools</h3>
                <p class="thing-description">
                    F1 in schools is a racing competition affiliated with the actual F1 organization.
                     In this competition miniature cars are raced along a drag strip, and teams are
                      supposed to enact as formula 1 teams, which involves developing the car, garnering 
                      sponsorships, marketing, and much more. My team and I (I designed the car) participated 
                      in this competition last year in the National round in Noida. It was a rollercoaster of 
                      a competition for us. Our car kept breaking again and again due to its thin design and
                       had to fix it after each round. However, right before the final round our car just wasn’t 
                       getting fixed and we had to resort to our B car, which was slower. Somehow, the B car
                        managed to beat our A car by a big margin and almost secured 1st place
                     in the races. Our car ended up finishing 2nd fastest out of 97 teams.

                <h3>3D Printing</h3>
                <p class="thing-description">
                    I think it was towards the end of 2021 that I had asked my dad for a 3D Printer, 
                    seeing that I’ve been doing decent in 3D design, he agreed. At first I researched a ton, 
                    learnt about the details of 3d printing, all the different types, etc. Then we landed on 
                    the ender 3 v2. Then when it arrived it was all disassembled, and I had to tediously piece 
                    together the entire 3d printer. Then everything went well and I made lots of things…No. 
                    For about a month or so it was just there because there was some problem that I couldn’t fix.
                     Then after a month or so later we called a guy to look at it and fix it. Flash-forward 3
                      years and I’ve made countless things with it. Keychains, machines, fridge magnets and more.
                     For me 3D printing is a way to make the things I want to make without any restriction

                <p class="thing-description">
                    In between 4th and 5th grade I saw some people being able to solve a rubik’s cube, 
                    so I decided to learn as well. At first my timings were pretty slow and ranged between 
                    2-3 minutes.  But as I kept practicing and improving my techniques my times kept getting 
                    better: 1 minute, 40 seconds, 30 seconds, 25 seconds, and at some point it reached around 
                    an average of 12 seconds. At this point I had picked up many other variations of the cube 
                    like the 2x2, 4x4, and the 5x5 and competed in many competitions. As time went by and I kept
                     competing my
                     averages got to the point of 8-9 seconds and my best time ever was 6.63 seconds.
