                <p>Apart from being a student I like to work on things I find interesting and challenging. 
                    For example, I love f1, everything from the racing to the physics behind it. That's why 
                    I designed the car for the f1 in schools competition and secured 2nd place out of 95 teams.

                <p class="thing-description">
                    Right after my 10th grade board exams I wanted to make websites for clients. So,
                     I decided to cold call a couple of CAs. After some time one CA agreed to me making 
                     a complete website for him, at the time I said I would do it for free. Then, as 
                     time went by he sent me all the details and I started coding the website. We discussed 
                     about what all he wanted in his website,
                     and after going back and forth the website was ready to deploy.
                     Also, because the website is hosted for free it may take a while to open sometimes.

                    to make profit for the team.

                <p class="thing-description">
                    I think it was towards the end of 2021 when I had asked my dad for a 3D Printer. 
                    Seeing that I was doing decent in 3D design, he agreed. After researching and learning 
                    about 3D printers we landed on the Ender 3 v2. Finally, when it arrived it was completely 
                    disassembled because of which I had to tediously piece together the entire 3d printer. 
                    Then, everything went well and I made lots of things…
                    No. For about a month or so it was 
                    lying around because there was some problem that I couldn't fix. After a month or so later 
                    we called someone to fix it. 
                    Flash-forward 3 years and I have thoroughly enjoyed using my 3D printer. Being able 
                    to make and design new things without any restriction makes this one of my favorite things to do.
