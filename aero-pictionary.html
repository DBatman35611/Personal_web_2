        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p> I developed an Aerodynamics Pictionary game in which participants had to use my 'printer' to draw the object they selected.
                    
            My 'printer' consisted of a fan, an airfoil (imagine a mini airplane wing), a belt, and a paper screen.
            
            By varying the speed of the fan, the airfoil would move up and down, and by turning the belt, participants could move it side to side.
            
            A paintbrush that was attached to the airfoil would draw along the screen as the airfoil moved.
            
        </p>

                        In the video you can see that after I increase the fan speed the airfoil (bright red shape)
                        moves up (due to increase in lift). As it moves up you can see that it draws a line. Then, as I
                        turn the belt the airfoil moves to the right, and the brush keeps drawing along the screen. Finally, 
                        when i decrease the fan speed, and lift decreases, the airfoil falls.
